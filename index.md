# Building Strong Communities

> "The way we build our communities is the foundation of our future prosperity." - Charles Marohn

Welcome to STRONG.BUILD, where we explore and document traditional building techniques that create lasting, resilient communities. Our mission is inspired by the StrongTowns movement and their principles of sustainable, financially resilient development.

## Why Traditional Building Matters

> "The traditional development pattern evolved over thousands of years of human trial and error. It can't be improved with simple engineering." - StrongTowns

Traditional building methods offer proven solutions for:
- Creating human-scaled environments
- Building incrementally and adaptably
- Using local, sustainable materials
- Fostering community resilience
- Maintaining cultural heritage
